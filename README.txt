This repository contains the labs and assignments I worked on in Spring 2014 for
Comp 20 (Web Development) at Tufts University.

My favourite assignment was the security assessment we ran on other people's applications (Security).

I am most proud of the MBTA 'tracker'  we built ('transit')

This class gave me a tase of both client side and server side programming. It has helped me understand a little but about how things on the internet work.
